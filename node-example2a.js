var circle = require('./node-example2.js');

console.log(`The area of a circle of radius 4 is ${circle.area(4)}`); //this is template literal syntax. It uses backticks instead of quotes. It allows you to embed expressions inside the string using ${expression} syntax. This is a more modern way of writing strings in JavaScript, and it makes the code easier to read and write. The expression inside the ${} is evaluated and inserted into the string at that position.
// console.log('The area of a circle of radius 4 is  ' +circle.area(4)); //this is an alternative way of writing the same thing above
